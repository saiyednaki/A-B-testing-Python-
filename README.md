**A/B Testing for Marketing Campaigns using Python**

**Project Overview**

This project focuses on applying A/B testing techniques to evaluate the effectiveness of marketing strategies using Python.
The goal is to determine which marketing variant performs better in terms of customer engagement and conversion, enabling data-driven decision-making and improved campaign performance.

**Business Problem**

Marketing teams often launch campaigns without clear evidence of which strategy will deliver better results.
This project addresses that challenge by statistically comparing two campaign variants (A and B) to identify whether changes in messaging, design, or offers lead to higher conversions.

**Objectives**
  - Compare the performance of two marketing variants
  - Measure key metrics such as conversion rate and engagement
  - Use statistical testing to validate results
  - Provide actionable recommendations for future campaigns

**Methodology**
1. Data Cleaning & Preparation
  - Removed missing and inconsistent values
  - Prepared data for statistical analysis

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  - Compared conversion and engagement metrics
  - Visualized performance differences between variants

3. A/B Testing
  - Defined null and alternative hypotheses
  - Conducted statistical tests (e.g., t-test / z-test)
  - Evaluated statistical significance

4. Result Interpretation
  - Interpreted test results to support marketing decisions

**Key Insights**
  - Identified which variant performed better
  - Determined whether observed differences were statistically significant
  - Highlighted customer behavior patterns influencing campaign performance

**Business Recommendations**
  - Roll out the higher-performing variant across future campaigns
  - Use A/B testing as a standard approach for marketing optimization
  - Continuously test messaging, visuals, and offers to improve conversions

**Tools & Technologies**
  - Python
  - Pandas, NumPy
  - SciPy / Statsmodels
  - Matplotlib, Seaborn
  - Jupyter Notebook

**Conclusion**

This project demonstrates how A/B testing enables data-driven marketing decisions, reduces guesswork, and improves campaign effectiveness.
By leveraging statistical analysis, marketing teams can confidently optimize strategies and maximize ROI.
